        AN EXTREMELY RARE SIGHT ON THE ROAD
    </div>
    <div class="matter2">
        <p>With only 12 cars ever commissioned, few people will be lucky enough to see a Bacalar on the road. Those who do, however, will be struck by its powerful haunches – the result of a rear track 200 mm wider than that of a Continental 
            GT – and its 22” tri-finish wheels. </p>4 front and rear horizontal lights add to the forward-looking, dynamic character 
            that was first seen on the EXP 100 GT.A ‘wraparound’ cockpit design not only allows the interior and exterior design to blend together, but it also directs the air flow over the heads and around the sides of the occupants – combining exhilaration with extreme comfort.
