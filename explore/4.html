        OPEN-AIR EXHILARATION
    </div>
    <div class="matter2">
        <p>With no roof at all, the Bacalar is a genuine barchetta – a name given to roofless race cars in the early 20th 
            Century, based on an Italian term for ‘little boat’. Beyond its open top, however, this luxurious, two-seat 
            performance car has virtually nothing in common with those stripped-back early racers.</p>
            Powered by an uprated, twin-turbocharged, 6.0 litre Bentley W12 engine, it can propel its occupants to incredible 
            speeds. With a design inspired by the EXP 100 GT, Bentley’s stunning centenary concept car, the exterior look of 
            each car is the result of a collaboration with the individual customer, based on an unprecedented choice of rare 
            materials, exclusive paint options and new design themes.
