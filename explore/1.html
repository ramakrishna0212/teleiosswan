        ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS EVERYTHING
    </div>
    <div class="matter2">
        <p>In the Bentley Bacalar interior, a steeply angled centre console flows seamlessly into the dashboard, before the same 
        uninterrupted surfaces sweep out into the door panels and around the front seats, creating the wraparound effect. Behind
         each seat is an aerodynamic cowl – a nod to the barchetta inspiration – which conceals a semi-enclosed luggage pod, 
         allowing for a surprising amount of storage inside the cockpit.The closer you look, however, the more you see.</p> A new, 
         knurled pattern is featured on the air vents, the steering wheel controls, media and climate controls and even the 
         intricate speaker frets. A unique steering wheel, leather door and seat releases, and special digital instrumentation
          enhance the cabin still further. And with 148,199 individual stitches on each seat, the level of detail is simply 
          unrivalled.
